## Introduction

The field of data structures and algorithms is fundamental in computer science and plays a crucial role in software development. This repository aims to provide clear and concise implementations of common data structures and algorithms, accompanied by explanations and example usage.

## Data Structures

The following data structures are currently implemented in this repository:

- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Binary Search Tree
- Heap
- Hash Table
- Graph
- Trie

Each data structure has its own directory containing the implementation code along with documentation and usage examples.

## Algorithms

The following algorithms are currently implemented in this repository:

- Sorting Algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- Searching Algorithms (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search)
- Graph Algorithms (e.g., Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm)
- Dynamic Programming Algorithms
- Greedy Algorithms

Similar to data structures, algorithms have their own directory with implementation code, explanations, and example usage.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you find a bug, have an improvement suggestion, or want to add new data structures or algorithms, please follow the guidelines outlined in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.
